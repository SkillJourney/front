# Job Board Frontend ðŸš€


## Welcome to the Job Board project! This is the frontend for the job board application built using React. Users can view job listings, apply for jobs, and interact with the backend API for job-related functionalities.

### Using Ant Design ðŸŽ¨
SkillJourney uses Ant Design for UI components. For more customization and theming, check the official Ant Design documentation.

Here are a few key components we use:

- Button: For triggering actions (e.g., apply for a job).
- Card: For displaying job postings.

### Technologies Used ðŸ’»

- React: For building the user interface.

- Axios: For handling HTTP requests to the API.

- React Router: For routing between different pages (e.g., Home, Job Details).

- Material UI: For styling and UI components.
